When he was younger, Atif loved going to the beach. It meant a
whole week to play with his two older brothers, Aslam and
Ahmad. But then Aslam went away to college and now Ahmad
had to stay behind for his summer job. Atif was going to be the
only kid at his family's beach house. He pictured himself floating
in the water all by himself and sighed.

Before Atif and his parents left for the beach, Ahmad pulled Atif
aside. He handed Atif a sparkly silver seashell. "Aslam gave this
to me the summer I was ten. Now that you're ten, its your turn,"
Ahmad explained. "When you get to the beach, dip this seashell
into the ocean."

"What will happen?" Atif asked.

"You'll see," Ahmad said with a wink.

  Q1 How many brothers did Atif have?

A One                      B Two                                 C Three       D None

                                          A tiny seed fell from a tall tree,
                                   And thought, "What will become of me?"

                                       Buried deep under soil and ground,
                                     It couldn't see, couldn't hear a sound.
                                   But it felt the warmth of the sun one day,
                               And pushed through the earth, finding its way.

                                             Up it grew, green and tall,
                                      Into a tree, proud and strong for all.
