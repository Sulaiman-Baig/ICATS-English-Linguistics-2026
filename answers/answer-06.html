                        <p>One day, Beep noticed that Grandma was sad. She missed her garden, but her old legs couldn't let her work outside anymore.</p>
                        <p>"I have an idea!" said Beep. He built a small indoor garden with special lights. He planted all of Grandma's favorite flowers.</p>
