                    </div>
                    <p class="explanation">The crow could not drink from the pot because the water was at the bottom and her beak could not reach it. The story states the pot was "tall" and the water level was too low.</p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <p class="explanation">The crow's clever solution was to drop pebbles one by one into the pot. Each pebble raised the water level a little bit until she could reach it with her beak.</p>

                    <p class="explanation">The crow's determination to find a solution despite the challenge teaches us that where there's a will, there's a way. She didn't give up and found a creative solution.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="explanation">The main lesson is about the power of thinking and problem-solving. The crow didn't just try harder at the same approach - she thought of a completely new solution.</p>
